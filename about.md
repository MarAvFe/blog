I'm a software developer from Costa Rica, interested in consumer IT security approach. I educate the average John Doe in how to be safer on the internet. But this blog is where I document my own research and experiments.

Hopefully some people can read and share this knowledge around the world. It does sound like an interesting outcome. For now, just be welcome and learn away.
